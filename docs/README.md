# screego/server

Screego was created because of a displeasure against cooperate chatting solutions.
For developers, screen sharing shouldn't be optimized for low bandwidth or presenting some slides.
It should be high definition, that you still can read the tiny font of your colleague.
No more, "wait a minute, the stream isn't updating".

Screego is an addition to existing software and only helps to share your screen. Nothing else (:.

* Multi User Screenshare
* Secure transfer via WebRTC
